# Egg Drop in Two

Determine which floor, when an egg is dropped will break the egg. 

The objective is to create an algorithm that will discover the lowest drop that will break the egg in the most efficient manner possible.

### Given 
- a 100-floor building
- two eggs
- each egg is individually packaged and insulated
- the packaging is exactly the same and so are the eggs
- if the egg doesn't break when dropped, it incurs no cumulative damage
- you can drop an egg unlimited times until it break
