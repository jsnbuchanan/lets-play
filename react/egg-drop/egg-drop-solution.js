 * Credit for this test goes to David Cross and Scott Hawker (https://twitter.com/yarell)
 * at CommerceHub.
 *
 * We're going to do an experiment using a 100-story building and 2 eggs.
 *
 * Using as few drops as possible, you'll need to drop the eggs from
 * different floors in order to determine the highest floor from which an egg
 * can be dropped without breaking.
 *
 * The following constraints should be observed:
 *   - You cannot drop an egg from more than 1 floor at a time.
 *   - You may reuse any eggs that remain unbroken after dropping them.
 *   - The eggs are the same - if one breaks from the 30th floor, the other will as well.
 *   - If an egg breaks from a given floor, it will break from all floors above it.
 *   - If an egg does not break from a given floor, it will not break from all floors below it.
 *
 * <strong>Describe the process by which you would make this determination.</strong>
 *
 * Keep in mind the goal of this question isn't for you to come up with the answer weâ€™re looking for on your own.
 *
 * We hope to gain insight to how you approach & solve a tough problem if we brought you on the team.
 *
 * Please feel free to work through ideas & process <strong>with us as your teammates</strong>.
 *
 * @param eggs cache with two unbroken eggs
 * @param building with 100 floors
 * @returns {number} the lowest floor number where an egg dropped, would break
